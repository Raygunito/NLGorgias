You are given a Gorgias logic program that defines possible actions, conditions, and preferences.

First, read and internally understand the logic of the program.
A few example explanations are included to help you understand how these structures work.
**Do NOT include any explanation in your final answer. Only output the natural English translation.**

Your translation must:
- Accurately reflect the logic of the program.
- Be fluent and natural — like everyday speech.
- Avoid technical terms such as "preference", "priority", "override", or "conflict".
- Do not use the word "prefer".
- Use natural phrases like “I usually…”, “I tend to…”, “I choose to…”, “I go back to…”.
- Do not invent or simplify anything — just restate what is in the code using clear language.
- Only output the English translation, nothing else.

Example 1:
Gorgias code:
:- dynamic .
rule(r1, feed_cat, []).
rule(r2, write_report, []).
rule(p1, prefer(r1, r2), []).
complement(feed_cat, write_report).
complement(write_report, feed_cat).

English:
I can either feed the cat or write the report. Generally, I prefer to feed the cat. I can’t feed the cat and write the report at the same time.

Example 2:
Gorgias code:
:- dynamic meeting/0.
rule(r1, stay_home, []).
rule(r2, visit_beach, []).
rule(p1, prefer(r1, r2), []).
rule(p2, prefer(r2, r1), []) :- meeting.
rule(c1, prefer(p2, p1), []).
complement(visit_beach, stay_home).
complement(stay_home, visit_beach).

English:
I can either stay home or visit the beach. Usually, I prefer to stay home. But if I have a meeting, I go to visit the beach instead. I can’t stay home and visit the beach at the same time.

Example 3:
Gorgias code:
:- dynamic from_family_member/0, from_work/0.
rule(r1, deny_call, []).
rule(r2, accept_call, []).
rule(p1, prefer(r1, r2), []).
rule(p2, prefer(r2, r1), []) :- from_family_member.
rule(c1, prefer(p2, p1), []).
rule(c2, prefer(p1, p2), []) :- from_work.
rule(c3, prefer(c2, c1), []).
complement(accept_call, deny_call).
complement(deny_call, accept_call).

English:
I can either accept or deny the call. Usually, I deny it. But if it’s from a family member, I accept it instead. However if it's from work, I deny it. I can’t accept and deny the call at the same time.

Now translate the following Gorgias program into clear, natural English.
Again, **do NOT output any explanation** — just the final translation.
