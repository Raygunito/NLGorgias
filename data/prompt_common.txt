You are given a Gorgias logic program that defines possible actions, conditions, and preferences.

First, read and internally understand the logic of the program.
A few example explanations are included to help you understand how these structures work.
**Do NOT include any explanation in your final answer. Only output the natural English translation.**

Your translation must:
- Accurately reflect the logic of the program.
- Be fluent and natural — like everyday speech.
- Avoid technical terms such as "preference", "priority", "override", or "conflict".
- Do not use the word "prefer".
- Use natural phrases like “I usually…”, “I tend to…”, “I choose to…”, “I go back to…”.
- Do not invent or simplify anything — just restate what is in the code using clear language.
- Only output the English translation, nothing else.

Example 1:
Gorgias code:
:- dynamic dinner_invitation/0.
rule(r1, stay_home, []) :- dinner_invitation.
rule(r2, pay_bills, []) :- dinner_invitation.
rule(p1, prefer(r1, r2), []).
complement(stay_home, pay_bills).
complement(pay_bills, stay_home).

English:
If I get a dinner invitation, I can either stay home or pay the bills. Generally, I prefer to stay home. I can’t stay home and pay the bills at the same time.

Example 2:
Gorgias code:
:- dynamic flight_delay/0, weekend/0
rule(r1, prepare_presentation, []) :- flight_delay.
rule(r2, save_money, []) :- flight_delay.
rule(p1, prefer(r1, r2), []).
rule(p2, prefer(r2, r1), []) :- weekend.
rule(c1, prefer(p2, p1), []).
complement(prepare_presentation, save_money).
complement(save_money, prepare_presentation).

English:
If there is a flight delay, I can either prepare a presentation or save money. Usually, I prefer to prepare a presentation. However if it's the weekend, I save money instead. I can’t prepare a presentation and save money at the same time.

Example 3:
Gorgias code:
:- dynamic nice_weather/0, nice_movie_tv/0, invitation_from_friend/0.
rule(r1, go_out, []) :- nice_weather.
rule(r2, stay_home, []) :- nice_weather.
rule(p1, prefer(r1,r2), []).
rule(p2, prefer(r2,r1), []) :- nice_movie_tv.
rule(c1, prefer(p2,p1), []).
rule(c2, prefer(p1,p2), []) :- invitation_from_friend.
rule(c3, prefer(c2,c1), []).
complement(go_out, stay_home).
complement(stay_home, go_out).

English:
If the weather is nice, I can either go out or stay home. Usually, I go out. But if there’s a nice movie on TV, I stay home instead. However, if a friend invites me, I go out again. I can’t go out and stay home at the same time.

Now translate the following Gorgias program into clear, natural English.
Again, **do NOT output any explanation** — just the final translation.
