                "content": "Your task is to translate natural English descriptions of decision-making behavior into Gorgias code.\n\nFirst, read and internally understand the logic of the program.\nA few example explanations are included to help you understand how these structures work.\n\nYour output must:\n- Be written **only in valid Gorgias code**.\n- Define all necessary rules, preferences, and complements.\n- Include any required dynamic facts (use `:- dynamic ...` where needed).\n- Capture all conditional preferences and logic accurately.\n- **Avoid adding any explanations, comments, or natural language just output the code**.\n\nWhen there is a condition on the right side of the rule, it should be added to the dynamic facts with the correct name and arity.\nWhen there is a complement of 2 actions, it should be added to the end of the code and it should be symmetric : complement(A,B) and complement(B,A) appear in the code.\n\n---\n\nExample 1:\nGorgias code:\n:- dynamic nice_weather/0, nice_movie_tv/0, invitation_from_friend/0.\nrule(r1, go_out, []) :- nice_weather.\nrule(r2, stay_home, []) :- nice_weather.\nrule(p1, prefer(r1,r2), []).\nrule(p2, prefer(r2,r1), []) :- nice_movie_tv.\nrule(c1, prefer(p2,p1), []).\nrule(c2, prefer(p1,p2), []) :- invitation_from_friend.\nrule(c3, prefer(c2,c1), []).\ncomplement(go_out, stay_home).\ncomplement(stay_home, go_out).\n\nEnglish:\nIf the weather is nice, I can either go out or stay home. Usually, I go out. But if there's a nice movie on TV, I stay home instead. However, if a friend invites me, I go out again. I can't go out and stay home at the same time.\n\n---\n\nExample 2:\nGorgias code:\n:- dynamic from_family_member/0, from_work/0.\nrule(r1, deny_call, []).\nrule(r2, accept_call, []).\nrule(p1, prefer(r1, r2), []).\nrule(p2, prefer(r2, r1), []) :- from_family_member.\nrule(c1, prefer(p2, p1), []).\nrule(c2, prefer(p1, p2), []) :- from_work.\nrule(c3, prefer(c2, c1), []).\ncomplement(accept_call, deny_call).\ncomplement(deny_call, accept_call).\n\nEnglish:\nI can either accept or deny the call. Usually, I deny it. But if it's from a family member, I accept it instead. But if it's from work, I deny it. I can't accept and deny the call at the same time.\n\n---\n\nExample 3:\nGorgias code:\n:- dynamic team_project_due/0, night_time/0, rainy_day/0, important_meeting/0, new_restaurant_to_try/0.\nrule(r1, go_shopping, []) :- team_project_due.\nrule(r2, visit_doctor, []) :- night_time.\nrule(p1, prefer(r1, r2), []) :- team_project_due, night_time.\nrule(p2, prefer(r2, r1), []) :- team_project_due, night_time, rainy_day.\nrule(c1, prefer(p2, p1), []).\nrule(c2, prefer(p1, p2), []) :- important_meeting.\nrule(c3, prefer(c2, c1), []).\nrule(c4, prefer(c1, c2), []) :- new_restaurant_to_try.\nrule(c5, prefer(c4, c3), []).\ncomplement(visit_doctor, go_shopping).\ncomplement(go_shopping, visit_doctor).\n\nEnglish:\nIf I have a team project due, I go shopping. If it's nighttime, I visit the doctor. But if it's both nighttime and I have a project due, I usually go shopping. If it's also a rainy day, I visit the doctor instead. However if I have an important meeting, I prefer to shopping. But If I have a new restaurant to try, I prefer to visit the doctor. I can't go shopping and visit the doctor at the same time.\n\n---\n\nNow translate the following English text into Gorgias code.\nAgain, only output the final code \u00e2\u20ac\u201d no explanations, comments, or extra text.\nIf I have a good investment, I visit the doctor. If there is a discount on a flight, I do laundry. But if I have both a good investment and a discount on a flight, I usually prefer to visit the doctor. However, if it's also early morning, I choose to do laundry instead. If there's a relationship break, I go back to visiting the doctor. But if I have an urgent deadline, I tend to do laundry. I can't do laundry and visit the doctor at the same time."
